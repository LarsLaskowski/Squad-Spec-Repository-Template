# Decision records

Why the code is the way it is. Each file records one decision — its context, the options considered, what
was chosen and the consequences — so that months later the reasoning is still available without the
pull request, the issue thread or the session that produced it.

A record explains the *why*. What holds today — formats, limits, error behavior, guarantees — is written down
once in the [area document](../areas/README.md) of the record's area, and the record links to it.
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes how the parts fit together. When a decision changes the architecture,
`ARCHITECTURE.md` is updated as well and links the record.

## Rules

- One decision per file: `NNNN-short-title.md` (four digits, next free number), created from
  [`_template.md`](_template.md).
- **The record states the decision in one to three sentences and does not restate behavior.** Context,
  *Options considered* and *Consequences* carry the reasoning; the rules of the resulting behavior (values,
  formats, limits, error texts) belong in the area document and are linked from the record.
- The `Area:` field names the record's area as listed in [`docs/areas/README.md`](../areas/README.md), or `—`
  for a record about the process or about no area. Once areas are defined, every record needs the field. For a
  released record it is part of the content: it changes only through a new record.
- Written by the squad Lead (see [`.squad/agents/lead/charter.md`](../../.squad/agents/lead/charter.md));
  anyone may add one for a change made outside the squad.
- Committed together with the change it explains.
- **Released or not decides how a record changes.** A record is *released* once the commit that added it is
  contained in a release tag (`v*`; check with `git tag --contains <commit>`, the commit is
  `git log --diff-filter=A --format=%H -- <file>`). Until the first release nothing is released.
- A record that is **not yet released** is edited in place, in the pull request that changes the decision
  (status stays `Proposed` or `Accepted`). Its history is Git and the pull request; there is no
  `Superseded by` chain for it. A record that no longer applies is deleted (numbers are never reused, gaps are
  fine) together with its index row and every link to it.
- A **released** record is **append-only**: it is never rewritten. A changed decision gets a new record that
  names the old one under *Supersedes*, and the old record's status becomes `Superseded by NNNN` (the only
  edit allowed). `Superseded by` is therefore only ever set on a released record.
- A new record that **amends** a released record without superseding it names the older one under
  *Supersedes* and says there, in one sentence, what it amends. The older record is **not edited** — not even
  with a pointer; a reader of the older record finds the amendment through the index and the new record.
- **One record per decision that has lasting weight, grouped by topic — not one per pull request.** Not for
  routine changes: a record is needed when a choice between real alternatives was made that shapes the
  architecture or behavior, a trade-off or limitation was accepted, or a documented guarantee was touched.
  Before adding a record, look for an unreleased record on the same topic and extend it instead. A review
  finding that was deliberately not fixed, a follow-up split, or a dependency change gets its own record only
  if it touches a guarantee or the architecture; otherwise it belongs in the pull request description or the
  follow-up issue, or as a sentence in the record of the topic it concerns.
- `.squad/tools/decision-check.py` (also run by `config-check.py`) checks the index, the links between records
  and that no released record was changed.
